# Shuttle

> Introduction: The warehouse is a middleware summed up by individuals based on business experience. The main usage scenarios are as follows:
> 
> 1. A service with high concurrency but low database IO.
> 
> 2. A service that need to keep multiple concurrent data in sync.
> 
> 3. A service that require high-concurrency interfaces for high-cost single reporting.


Use the data pool to temporarily store high-concurrency data, and then use the shuttle function to process it in batches. After processing, the data pool is emptied and waits for the next batch of data to enter.

The project is currently go 1.18 version.

At the same time, this method will also trigger the configured shuttle function for the last time, so that the temporary storage But as to time the data gets processed.

### Example
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"Tsuirongu/shuttle"
)

func main() {
	a := shuttle.New(
		shuttle.WithFunc(func(m map[string]interface{}) error {
		count := 0
		for _, _ = range m {
			count += 1
		}
		fmt.Println(count)

		return nil
	}), 
	shuttle.WithDuration(60*time.Second), 
	shuttle.WithMaxSize(100))

	a.AddData("key", "value")
	defer func() {
		if err:=recover(); err!=nil {
			a.Exit()
		}
	}()
}
```
